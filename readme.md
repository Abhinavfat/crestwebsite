# CREST website repository

Abhinav look at this before you change anything.
I have added some python to make the website run with different pages and later add the files.

What I want you to do is:

- Finish the videos page by creating a div for each video. There should be five video divs. For now just use a random video and I'll add safe captures later.

- Finish the faces page by creating, for now, one div with a face and buttons to delete it.

To run the website, go to app.py and press the run button. In the output or terminal there will be a link. Ctrl click it and it will take you to the website. After that when you make a change just reload the page to see it.

When you write code for videos.html and faces.html I have written a p tag. There will be a line of code above it and below it. Write your code between them. You don't need to write head and body tags as the other lines have already inherited them. Just write content like headers and ps.

For css inside static/styles you will find style.css. In that file you can write the css.

# DO NOT CHANGE BASE.HTML OR APP.PY
